                            <p>SQL, which is short for Structured Query Language, is a database computer language designed for accessing 
                                and manipulating databases. This guide will provide a quick introduction to SQL covering basic topics to 
                                give you an overview of the language and its capabilities.</p>
                            
                            <h3>RDBMS Concepts</h3>
                            <p>RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. This is the basis for SQL, and for modern database systems 
                               like MS-SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access. It is a structuring of data into database tables, 
                               records and fields. Each database table has rows of data consisting of one or more fields. The records stored in each 
                               table is data that has been logically grouped together, like all customer information or all order information. 
                               This organization of data into specific tables is called normalization.</p>
                            
                            <h3>What is Normalization?</h3>  
                            <p>Database normalization is the process of efficiently organizing data in a database. This process eliminates redundant data, for example, 
                               storing the same data in more than one table and ensures that data dependencies make sense. The benefits of this are saving space in database 
                               storage and making sure that data is stored in a logical form resulting in faster operations.</p>

                            <p>Imagine that you are responsible for keeping track of all the books being checked out of a library. You could use a single table to track all the 
                               critical information such as name, address, phone, book title and due date to name a few. This single table meets the basic need to keep track of 
                               who has checked out which book, but does have some serious flaws in terms of efficiency, space required, and maintenance time. </p>
                               
                            </p>For example, as voracious reader Bob checks out more books over time, you will have to re-enter all of his 
                               contact information for every book each time. To re-enter Bob’s contact information wastes time, and increases the opportunity for error. 
                               Also, when an update is necessary like a change of address or phone number, each of Bob’s records must be located and corrected. If one of 
                               Bob’s records has a different phone number from the rest, is it a correction, a record overlooked during the last update, or a data-entry mistake?</p>


                            <p>Many of these issues are avoided by dividing the information into multiple tables with the goal of having “a place for everything, and 
                                everything in its place.” Each piece of information should appear just once, simplifying data maintenance and decreasing the storage 
                                space required.</p>

                            <h3>Schema</h3>
                            <p>A schema is a logical database object holder. A database schema of a database system is its structure described in a formal language supported 
                                by the database management system. In simpler terms, schema is a container for database objects. It's a convention to help you better organize your 
                                tables. </p>

                    <header>Syntax</header>
                        <article>
                            <p>SQL follows a set of rules and guidelines called Syntax. Statement, which are like directions to follow, start with keywords like SELECT, INSERT, 
                               UPDATE, DELETE, ALTER, DROP, CREATE, USE, and SHOW to name just a few. All statements end with a semicolon (;). SQL is case insensitive, meaning 
                               that the keyword SELECT or select, will have the same meaning in SQL statements. The standard practice and what you see most often is uppercase 
                               for keywords.</p>

                            <p>There are many popular RDBMS available to work with. MS SQL Server, MySQL, Oracle and MS Access are some of the most popular. Although (in theory) SQL 
                                is standardized, in practice each vendor has their own "extensions" (variations) on the language so it is always best to review the documentation for 
                                your RDBMS. For example, MySQL is case sensitive with table naming so if you are working with MySQL you will need to use table names in your SQL statements 
                                as they exist in the database.</p>

                            <h3>SQL SELECT Statement</h3>
                            <p>The following SQL statement selects a number of fields from a given table. The result would be all the records from that table showing just the fields in the 
                                SELECT statement. This is useful if you have 20 fields in a record and only want the information from 5 of them.</p>

                            <code>SELECT Column1, Column2, ...ColumnN
FROM table_name;</code>

                            <h3>SQL WHERE Clause</h3>
                            <p>The WHERE clause allows you to use a condition on your query statement. Maybe you only want customers for a certain zip code.</p>
                            <code>SELECT column1, column2....columnN
FROM   table_name
WHERE  CONDITION;</code>

                            <p>Notice that you can have a statement written all on one line or on multiple lines to make reading and understanding easier. The statement is not 
                            finished until it reaches the semicolon.</p>

                            <h3>Syntax</h3>
                            <code>CREATE DATABASE DatabaseName;</code>

                            <p>The database name should always be unique within the schema (your RDBMS).</p>

                        <p><strong>NOTE -</strong>Be careful before using this operation. Dropping an existing database will result in loss of complete information stored in the database.</p>

                        <p>Creating a table in your database involves naming the table and defining its columns and each column's data type.</p>

                        <p>The data type is a guideline for SQL to understand what type of data is expected inside of each column, and it also identifies how SQL will 
                            interact with the stored data. <strong>Note:</strong> Data types might have different names in different RDBMS.</p>

                        <p>The SQL <strong>CREATE TABLE</strong> statement is used to create a new table.</p>

                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <code>CREATE TABLE table_name(
column1 datatype,
column12 datatype,
column3 datatype,
..... 
columnN datatype,
PRIMARY KEY( one or more columns )</code>

                    <p>CREATE TABLE is the keyword telling the database system what you want to do. In this case, you want to create a new table. The unique name 
                        or identifier for the table follows the CREATE TABLE statement.</p>

                    <p>Then in brackets comes the list defining each column in the table and what sort of data type it is. The syntax becomes clearer with the following 
                        example.</p>

                    <h3>Example</h3>
                    <p>The following code block is an example, which creates a CUSTOMERS table with an ID as a primary key and NOT NULL are the constraints showing that 
                       these fields cannot be NULL while creating records in this table −</p>

                    <code>CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS(
ID   INT              NOT NULL,
NAME VARCHAR (20)     NOT NULL,
AGE  INT              NOT NULL,
ADDRESS  CHAR (25) ,
SALARY   DECIMAL (18, 2),       
PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);</code>

                    <p>The <strong>PRIMARY KEY</strong> constraint uniquely identifies each record in a table. Primary keys must contain UNIQUE values, and cannot 
                        contain NULL values. A table can have only one primary key, which may consist of single or multiple fields. Most times the primary key field 
                    will be set to auto-increment.</p>

                    <p>Auto-increment allows a unique number to be generated automatically when a new record is inserted into a table.</p>

                    <p>A <strong>FOREIGN KEY</strong> is a key used to link two tables together. A <strong>FOREIGN KEY</strong> is a field (or collection of fields) 
                        in one table that refers to the PRIMARY KEY in another table.</p>

                    <p>The table containing the foreign key is called the child table, and the table containing the matching primary key is called the referenced or 
                        parent table.</p>

                        <p>The SQL DROP TABLE statement is used to remove a table and all of it's data.</p>    
                        
                        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> − You should be very careful while using this command because once a table is deleted 
                            then all the information available in that table will also be lost forever.</p>

                            <h3>Syntax</h3>

                        <p>The SQL <strong>INSERT INTO</strong> Statement is used to add new rows of data to a table in the database.</p>   
                        
                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>There are two basic syntaxes of the INSERT INTO statement which are shown below.</p>

                        <p>Here, column1, column2, column3,...columnN are the names of the columns in the table into which you want to insert the data.</p>
                        <code>INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME (column1, column2, column3,...columnN)  
VALUES (value1, value2, value3,...valueN);</code>

                        <p>You may not need to specify the column(s) name in the SQL query if you are adding values for all the columns of the table. 
                            But make sure the order of the values is in the same order as the columns in the table.</p>
                        <code>INSERT INTO TABLE_NAME VALUES (value1,value2,value3,...valueN);</code>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Lets add three records to the CUSTOMERS table.</p>
                        <code>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (1, 'Ramesh', 32, 'Ahmedabad', 2000.00 );
                                
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (2, 'Khilan', 25, 'Delhi', 1500.00 );
                                
INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS (ID,NAME,AGE,ADDRESS,SALARY)
VALUES (3, 'kaushik', 23, 'Kota', 2000.00 );</code>

                        <p>You can also do it this way -</p>
                        <code>INSERT INTO CUSTOMERS 
VALUES (7, 'Muffy', 24, 'Indore', 10000.00 );</code>

                        <h3>Populate one table using another table</h3>

                        <p>You can populate the data into a table through the select statement over another table; provided the other table has a set of fields, 
                            which are required to populate the first table.</p>

                        <p>Here is the syntax −</p>
                        <code>INSERT INTO first_table_name [(column1, column2, ... columnN)] 
SELECT column1, column2, ...columnN 
FROM second_table_name
[WHERE condition];</code>

                            These result tables are called result-sets.</p> 
                        
                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <code>SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;</code>

                        <p>Here, column1, column2... are the fields of a table whose values you want to fetch. If you want to fetch all the fields available in the field, 
                            then you can use the following syntax.</p>
                        <code>SELECT * FROM table_name;</code>

                        <p><strong>NOTE</strong> - You should only use the * if you really need all of the fields returned. In a large table with several fields it contributes to inefficiency that
                            can be avoided by specifying the required columns.</p>

                    <header>Where Clause</header>
                    <article>
                        <p>The SQL <strong>WHERE</strong> clause is used to specify a condition while fetching the data from a single table or by joining with multiple tables. If the 
                            given condition is satisfied, then it returns a specific value from the table. You should use the WHERE clause to filter the records and 
                            fetching only the necessary records.
                        </p> 

                        <p>The WHERE clause is not only used in the SELECT statement, but it is also used in the UPDATE, DELETE statement, etc., which we will examine 
                            in the subsequent chapters.</p>

                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <code>SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition]</code>

                        <p>You can specify a condition using the comparison or logical operators like &gt;, &lt, =, <strong>LIKE</strong>, <strong>NOT</strong>, etc.</p>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>The following code is an example which would fetch the ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table, where the salary is greater than 2000 −</p>
                        <code>SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 2000;</code>

                    <p>The result would be - </p>
                    <code>+----+----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | SALARY   |
+----+----------+----------+
|  4 | Chaitali |  6500.00 |
|  5 | Hardik   |  8500.00 |
|  6 | Komal    |  4500.00 |
|  7 | Muffy    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+----------+</code>

                    <p>The following query is an example, which would fetch the ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table for a customer with the name Hardik.</p>
                    <p>Here, it is important to note that all the strings should be given inside single quotes (''). Whereas, numeric values should be given without any 
                        quote as in the above example.</p>

                    <code>SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE NAME = 'Hardik';</code>

                    <p>This would produce -</p>
                    <code>+----+----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | SALARY   |

                    <article>
                        <p>The SQL <strong>AND</strong> & <strong>OR</strong> operators are used to combine multiple conditions to narrow data in an SQL statement. These two operators are called as 
                            the conjunctive operators.</p>    

                        <p>These operators provide a means to make multiple comparisons with different operators in the same SQL statement.</p>
                        
                        <h2>The AND Operator</h2>
                        <p>The AND operator allows the existence of multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The basic syntax of the AND operator with a WHERE clause is as follows −</p>
                        <code>SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition1] AND [condition2]...AND [conditionN];</code>

                        <p>You can combine N number of conditions using the AND operator. For an action to be taken by the SQL statement, whether it be a transaction 
                        or a query, all conditions separated by the AND must be TRUE.</p>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −</p>
                        <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |

|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
|  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</code>
                        <p>Following is an example, which would fetch the ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table, where the salary is greater than 2000 
                        and the age is less than 25 years −</p>

                        <code>SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY > 2000 AND age < 25;</code>

                        <p>This would produce the following result −</p>
                        <code>+----+-------+----------+
| ID | NAME  | SALARY   |
+----+-------+----------+
|  6 | Komal |  4500.00 |
|  7 | Muffy | 10000.00 |
+----+-------+----------+</code>

                        <h2>The OR Operator</h2>
                        <p>The OR operator is used to combine multiple conditions in an SQL statement's WHERE clause.</p>

                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The basic syntax of the OR operator with a WHERE clause is as follows −</p>
                        <code>SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition1] OR [condition2]...OR [conditionN];</code>

                        <p>You can combine N number of conditions using the OR operator. For an action to be taken by the SQL statement, 
                            whether it be a transaction or query, the only any ONE of the conditions separated by the OR must be TRUE.</p>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −</p>
                        <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</code>

                        <p>The following code block has a query, which would fetch the ID, Name and Salary fields from the CUSTOMERS table, where the salary is 
                            greater than 2000 OR the age is less than 25 years.</p>
                        <code>SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY 
FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY &gt; 2000 OR age &lt; 25;</code>

or
                                    
SELECT FROM table_name

                            <p>You can combine N number of conditions using AND or OR operators. Here, XXXX could be any numeric or string value.</p>

                            <ul>
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%'</strong><br />Finds any values that start with 200.</li> 
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '%200%'</strong><br />Finds any values that have 200 in any position.</li> 
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '_00%'</strong><br />Finds any values that have 00 in the second and third positions.</li> 
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '2_%_%'</strong><br />Finds any values that start with 2 and are at least 3 characters in length.</li> 
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '%2'</strong><br />Finds any values that end with 2.</li> 
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '_2%3'</strong><br />Finds any values that have a 2 in the second position and end with a 3.</li> 
                               <li><strong>WHERE SALARY LIKE '2___3'</strong><br />Finds any values in a five-digit number that start with 2 and end with 3.</li> 
                            </ul>

                            <p>Let's take a real example, consider the CUSTOMERS table having the records as shown below.</p>
                            <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
|  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
|  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
|  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
|  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
|  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</code>

                            <p>Following is an example, which would display all the records from the CUSTOMERS table, where the SALARY starts with 200.</p>
                            <code>SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS
WHERE SALARY LIKE '200%';</code>

                            <p>This would produce the following result −</p>
                            <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |

                    <article>
                        <p>The SQL <strong>TOP</strong> clause is used to fetch a TOP N number or X percent records from a table.</p>

                        <p><strong>Note</strong> − Not all databases support the TOP clause. For example MySQL supports the LIMIT clause to fetch limited 
                            number of records while Oracle uses the ROWNUM command to fetch a limited number of records.</p>
                        
                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The basic syntax of the TOP clause with a SELECT statement would be as follows.</p>
                        <code>SELECT TOP number|percent column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition];</code>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −</p>
                        <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
|  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
|  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</code>

                        <p>The following query is an example on the SQL server, which would fetch the top 3 records from the CUSTOMERS table.</p>
                        <code>SELECT TOP 3 * FROM CUSTOMERS;</code>
                        <p>This would produce the following result −</p>

                        <p>The SQL <strong>ORDER BY</strong> clause is used to sort the data in ascending or descending order, based on one or more columns. 
                            Some databases sort the query results in an ascending order by default.</p>

                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The basic syntax of the ORDER BY clause is as follows −</p>
                        <code>SELECT column-list 
FROM table_name 
[WHERE condition] 
[ORDER BY column1, column2, .. columnN] [ASC | DESC];</code>

                        <p>You can use more than one column in the ORDER BY clause. Make sure whatever column you are using to sort that column 
                            should be in the column-list.</p>

                            <h3>Example</h3>
                            <p>Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −</p>

                        <p>The SQL <strong>GROUP BY</strong> clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups. 
                            This GROUP BY clause follows the WHERE clause in a SELECT statement and precedes the ORDER BY clause.</p>  

                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The basic syntax of a GROUP BY clause is shown in the following code block. The GROUP BY clause must follow the conditions 
                            in the WHERE clause and must precede the ORDER BY clause if one is used.</p>
                        <code>SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name
WHERE [ conditions ]
GROUP BY column1, column2
ORDER BY column1, column2</code>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −</p>
                        <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</code>

                        <p>If you want to know the total amount of the salary on each customer, then the GROUP BY query would be as follows.</p>
                        <code>SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) FROM CUSTOMERS
GROUP BY NAME;</code>

                        <p>This would produce the following result −</p>

                        <p>Now, let us look at a table where the CUSTOMERS table has the following records with duplicate names −</p>
                        <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |

                        <p>Now again, if you want to know the total amount of salary on each customer, then the GROUP BY query would be as follows −</p>
                        <code>SELECT NAME, SUM(SALARY) FROM CUSTOMERS

                    <article>
                        <p>The SQL <strong>DISTINCT</strong> keyword is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement to eliminate all the duplicate records and 
                            fetching only unique records.</p>

                        <p>There may be a situation when you have multiple duplicate records in a table. While fetching such records, it makes more sense to fetch 
                            only those unique records instead of fetching duplicate records.</p>

                        <h3>Syntax</h3>
                        <p>The basic syntax of DISTINCT keyword to eliminate the duplicate records is as follows −</p>
                        <code>SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2,.....columnN 
FROM table_name
WHERE [condition]</code>

                        <h3>Example</h3>
                        <p>Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −</p>
                        <code>+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
| ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+

|  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+</code>

                        <p>First, let us see how the following SELECT query returns the duplicate salary records.</p>
                        <code>SELECT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS
ORDER BY SALARY;</code>

                        <p>This would produce the following result, where the salary (2000) is coming twice which is a duplicate 
                            record from the original table.</p>
                        <code>+----------+
| SALARY   |
+----------+
|  1500.00 |
|  2000.00 |
|  2000.00 |
|  4500.00 |
|  6500.00 |
|  8500.00 |
| 10000.00 |
+----------+</code>

                        <p>Now, let us use the DISTINCT keyword with the above SELECT query and then see the result.</p>
                        <code>SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS
ORDER BY SALARY;</code>

                        <p>This would produce the following result where we do not have any duplicate entry.</p>
                        <code>+----------+
| SALARY   |
+----------+
|  1500.00 |
|  2000.00 |
